Tiny Homes Paradise (Real Estate Marketplace) In this webpage, everyone is able to look for a tiny house and contact the owner of it. As a user, you will be able to register and login to your account. When you successfully login, you are able to put houses for sale. Users will be able to post and see other people's properties. Users will also have the ability to contact the owner of a property via email and phone in the property details page which will display the contact information of that specific user. https://github.com/Alchemi/Tiny_Home_Paradise
